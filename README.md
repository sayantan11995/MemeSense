## üß† Overview of MemeSense Workflow

MemeSense is a multi-stage framework for reasoning about **implicitly harmful memes**, leveraging **diverse commonsense cues** and **Cognitive Shift Vectors (CSVs)** for robust intervention generation.

The overall process consists of the following steps:

1. **Commonsense Generation Module**  
   Train a commonsense generation model using a set of memes and their corresponding ground-truth commonsense annotations.  
   - These commonsense labels are obtained via GPT-4o generations, followed by manual verification.  
   - Refer to [`commonsense_generation/`](./commonsense_generation) for data format and training scripts.

2. **Intervention Training via Cognitive Shift Vectors**  
   Use the curated meme‚Äìcommonsense‚Äìintervention triplets to train the CSV-enhanced intervention generation model.  
   - CSVs are learnable representations that capture how commonsense should influence the final response.  
   - Training and inference code is available in [`cognitive_shift_vectors/`](./cognitive_shift_vectors).

3. **Evaluation and Inference**  
   Once trained, the model can generate reasoned intervention responses for new memes ‚Äî including those lacking textual cues.  
   - Evaluation metrics include Semantic Similarity Score (SeSS), BERTScore, ROUGE, BLEU, and Readability.

> ‚öôÔ∏è This modular design ensures flexibility ‚Äî allowing users to integrate new memes, customize commonsense categories, or plug in alternate base models.
