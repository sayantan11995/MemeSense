IntMeme Interpretation,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xkt-6MCVtxnRi1kq6qYZ3oaZzQsavp-_/view?usp=drive_link,"The meme shows a black man sitting next to a UPS truck, with his pants down around his ankles. The text ""UPS man's package"" is overlaid on the image, indicating that it might be a sexual joke or a reference to the UPS employee having to deliver a package with an unusual or unexpected item. The presence of this meme could be construed as a form of racial bias and stereotyping, as it portrays black men as being less responsible, less professional, and possibly even less respectful. The meme may also be seen as objectifying and sexualizing black men, reinforcing harmful stereotypes about the African-American community."
